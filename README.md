viewer = new Casto({type: "viewer"})
viewer.onSendChannelsList = ({channels}) => {
  for (const channel in channels) {
    /* Do some stuff for channel list */
    button.addEventListener('click', ()=> {
      /* media should be a mediaElement for streaming */
      media.srcObject = await casto.getChannel(channel.peerId})
    })
  }
}
```

# Modules
![casto diagram](./assets/casto_diagram.png)
## sender ( `{type: "sender"}` )
module that send stream to specific `serviceId`
## viewer ( `{type: "viewer"}` )
module that receive channel list of `serviceId` and choose stream from the list to view.
## relay
service that relays copies of the sender's stream to viewers.
* https://prisms.casto.tv/serviceId=<SERVICE_ID>
* default: https://prisms.casto.tv/serviceId=TESTO

# API
## Methods
### Create a Casto - new Casto(options)
> create an instance of the Casto
Require keys in the `options` object:
* `type`: type of casto instance. If you want to do a broadcast, set `sender` or set `viewer` if you want to watch a broadcast.
* `serviceId`: default is `TESTO`
### casto.start(): MediaStream<Promise>
> start a broadcast by the Casto.
Should return a `MediaStream`, which is an object for transfer to the remote.

### casto.getChannel(peerId): MediaStream<Promise>
> Should return a `MediaStream`, which is an object that received broadcasting from `peerId`
